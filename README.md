STM libraries, headers, and samples have been modified to work with GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors toolchain and STM32F4 Discovery EVB. Generally, this just involved adding Makefiles and a slightly modified version of the TrueStudio linker file. In the Project directory, everything under Demonstration, FW\_upgrade, and Peripheral\_Examples is buildable from the command line by running 'make'.

STM's approach toward 'library code' is somewhat non-traditional. Rather than building libraries upfront and linking them with your source, STM appears to intend for you to include their source files in your code's build. Some of their source files include local headers and modules (i.e. stm32f4xx_conf.h, stm32f4xx_it.c/h, system_stm32f4xx.c, etc) that you modify/store in your source tree. Because of this, building the library upfront wouldn't work properly, as the configuration for some library modules could vary from project to project.
